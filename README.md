## Pointers

- Comments explaining design decisions are encouraged, but not required.
- These exercises are meant to take 1-2 hours. This timebox is not a limit, it is what we have in mind to be respectful of your time, but you may spend as much time as you wish on this. A fully architected enterprise solution is not expected, but adding //TODO's and additional comments explaining ways your code could be expanded into a production ready solution is also encouraged.
- Develop the solution in the framework you are most comfortable with. We limit the framework selection so that solutions can be evaluated with equal weight, regardless of tools used.
